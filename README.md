# Recurrent Neural Networks for Melody Generation

## How to Run:

-   This repo contains four main Python files:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`train_pitch.py`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`train_duration.py`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`gen_pitch.py`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`gen_duration.py`

-   First, the necessary packages must be installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-   Generating melodies from existing pre-trained weights:
    -   To generate a melody with the **Gen-pitch** system based on the existing pre-trained weights, run: `python src/gen_pitch.py`.
    -   To generate a melody with the **Gen-duration** system based on the existing pre-trained weights, run: `python src/gen_duration.py`.
-   Training the models:
    -   To train the **Gen-pitch** system, run: `python src/train_pitch.py`. A melody can then be generated using the command given above.
    -   To train the **Gen-duration** system, run: `python src/train_duration.py`. A melody can then be generated using the command given above.
-   **N.B.** The melody files generated by `gen_pitch.py` and `gen_duration.py` are MIDI files. In order to listen to them, you can use the EXE file included in the repo, called `MidiPlayer.exe`. This is a small program that facilitates listening to MIDI files.
-   If you would like to learn more about how these melody generation systems work, please see the report included in this repo.
